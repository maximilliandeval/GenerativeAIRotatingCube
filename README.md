Cool demonstration of how easily Chat GPT 3.5 can satisfy a request for a Python program.

> Write a Python program which displays an infinitely rotating 3D cube that is balanced on one corner

<br>

> To create a Python program that displays an infinitely rotating 3D cube balanced on one corner, you can use the pygame library for graphical display and PyOpenGL for 3D rendering. Below is a simple example of such a program:
https://github.com/maximilliandeval/GenerativeAIRotatingCube/blob/7a9e2a73a8ad9371b3186cff33826bda4a09e9da/RotatingCube.py#L1-L63
> Make sure you have pygame and PyOpenGL installed (pip install pygame PyOpenGL). This code sets up a window and continuously rotates a 3D cube around its center, giving the impression of a balanced cube.
