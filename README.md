Write a Python program which displays an infinitely rotating 3D cube that is balanced on one corner



To create a Python program that displays an infinitely rotating 3D cube balanced on one corner, you can use the pygame library for graphical display and PyOpenGL for 3D rendering. Below is a simple example of such a program:

...

Make sure you have pygame and PyOpenGL installed (pip install pygame PyOpenGL). This code sets up a window and continuously rotates a 3D cube around its center, giving the impression of a balanced cube.
